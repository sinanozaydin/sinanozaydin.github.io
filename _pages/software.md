`pide` is a Python3 library for calculating geophysical parameters (e.g., electrical conductivity, seismic velocity), employing the results from experimental petrology, mineral/rock physics, and thermomechanical modelling studies. `pide` can calculate the theoretical electrical conductivity of any earth material that exists in the literature. `pide` can also calculate seismic velocity utilising the external 'sister' library `santex`. Using these theoretical calculations, users can utilise inversion modules to decode geophysical anomalies compositionally or convert thermomechanical models into geophysical observables. With a given spatial mapping of earth materials, which can preferentially be loaded from a thermomechanical model, `pide`  can be used to build synthetic electrical conductivity and seismic velocity models and generate gravity and magnetic anomalies. Moreover, it is built as a modular tool, so users can easily build their functions.

<https://github.com/sinanozaydin/MATE>

MATE is an easy-to-use piece of software written in python3 for making interpretations of magnetotelluric models of the mantle. The software does this by combining the information of many high-pressure and temperature experimental studies (e.g., conductivity, hydrogen diffusion, hydration of minerals) for given compositional and thermal profile.

SAnTex
======
 <https://github.com/utpal-singh/SAnTex>

Developed by Utpal Singh, `SAnTex` is a Python library which calculates the full elastic tensor of rocks from modal mineral composition, crystallographic orientation, and a crystal stiffness tensor catalogue that accounts for the dependency of elasticity with pressure and temperature.
