I was priviliged to visit Summit Station and join the scientific team led by Kate Selway that made the first magnetotelluric deployments on the Greenland icesheet. Here is a collection of photos that I like to look at occasionaly (from Ã–zaydin & Selway, 2020 - G-Cubed).

<p>During deployment of MT stations sudden mists occasionaly came through, which not only decreased the visibility but also made the sensed temperature to drop drastically due to increase in humidity.</p>
