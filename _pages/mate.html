MATE is an easy-to-use piece of software written in python3 for making interpretations of magnetotelluric models of the mantle. The software does this by combining the information of many high-pressure and temperature experimental studies (e.g., conductivity, hydrogen diffusion, hydration of minerals) for given compositional and thermal profile.

The program is developed in such a way that adding new experimental models to it is a fairly easy process and can be done through adding entries in external csv files and python scripts. 

Who would be interested in using this program?
- Magnetotelluricists who wants to make interpretations on their models.
- Petrologists who conduct high-pressure and temperature conductivity and/or hydrogen diffusion studies to make comparisons with real data and other studies.

Installation
==========

Copying the files to a directory will do the job. However, the structure of the source folder should not be changed. Exporting the source folder is recommended.

The program could simply run by the command:


```bash
python3 MATE
```
