Kate Selway and I made a presentation on EMinar series (<a href="https://www.mtnet.info/EMinars/EMinars.html">EM geophysics community webinars</a>). We presented the general questions in adressing the link between magnteotelluric method and composition of the mantle. The talk then followed by tutorial of <a href="https://github.com/sinanozaydin/MATE">MATE</a>. The talk can be viewed from the following link to YouTube.
